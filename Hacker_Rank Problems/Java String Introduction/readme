Note Description:

This program performs operations on two user-provided strings, A and B. The following operations are executed:

    Calculate Total Length: The combined length of strings A and B is computed and printed.
    Lexicographical Comparison: Determines if string A is lexicographically larger than string B. Prints "Yes" if A is larger; otherwise, prints "No".
    Capitalize and Print: The first letter of each string is capitalized, and the transformed strings are printed on a single line, separated by a space.

Input Format:

    Two strings (A and B) composed of lowercase English letters.

Output Format:

    An integer representing the sum of the lengths of A and B.
    A string, either "Yes" or "No", based on the lexicographical comparison of A and B.
    The capitalized versions of A and B, separated by a space.
